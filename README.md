# sp-discord-handler
 ESM Discord Handler

After cloning the project:

Rename the:
```.env.example```
to:
```.env```

And replace your token.

If you prefer installing it using npx or pnmp, I am currently having same issues to set it up properly.
You can use:

```pnpm install sp-discord-handler --prefix /absolute/path/to/your/project```

It will be inside the node_modules folder and it will generate some other files and folders.

You can just copy the directory of sp-discord-handler to wherever you want it and delete the rest.

It is not important to work.
